# Legal-Document-AI-Extractor
The goal of this project was to build an AI-powered agent capable of analyzing complex legal documents—specifically the 'Credit Act 2025'—and extracting structured, actionable data. Manual review of such documents is time-consuming and prone to error, so we automated this using a Large Language Model (LLM)."
